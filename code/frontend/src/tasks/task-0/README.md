# Task 0: The Wails Philosophy

Welcome to this task, where we will see how to work with Wails!

> 📝 **Note:** On Windows host systems, please make sure to re-run the `wails dev` command when making changes in your Go code, this usually happens automatically, but is a limitation inside the docker environment.

> ❗ **Important:** While connection to the wails server is lost, you will see a loading animation which might not automatically finish, so be sure to refresh yourself after some seconds.


[Go to Task 0](../../../../backend/app.go)

### TODO: 0.1: create a function "Multiply"

Create a function `Multiply` for the multiplication of two numbers. 

> 💡 **Tip:** You can use `int`/`int64` or `float64`, if you want to support decimals!

### TODO: 0.2: comment in this import when you completed the function in app.go

[Got to Task 0 (Vue)](Task0.vue)

Comment the import back in once you finished Task 0.1!

### TODO: 0.3: use the commented out code to call your function

Replace the `0` with the commented out code `await Multiply(3, 6)`.


> ✅ **Complete:** Your Task should now work!
  
Again, don't forget to re-run the `wails dev` command as you made changes to the Go code.
